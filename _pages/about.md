I am a sophomore at the University of Hong Kong, majoring in Financial Technology.

- Currently, I am working at the [HKU Trustworthy AI and Systems Research (TASR) Lab](https://github.com/HKU-TASR) as an UG Research Assistant, advised by [Prof. Chow Ka-Ho](https://khchow.com) (He paid me good money, so I guess I am trustworthy enough :P)
- Also a member of [HKU Herkules RoboMaster Team](https://github.com/HKUAstar), mainly responsible for training and deploying the most stable, most accurate, and fastest detection models on edge devices.

  <summary>My current research focuses on defending personal privacy against retrieval systems based on face recognition models. Near-future works... (Unfold if you want to see me withering away)</summary>

  will be about enhancing the real-world readiness of Protego, including enhancing robustness, enabling authenticated AI inference, containing the blast of leakages, etc.

  But I am quite ready to go beyond. In terms of the longer-term plan, I actually aim for explainable AI. The capability of AI models have demonstrated the deep connection between data and knowledge, which are also core ingredients of human intelligence. And EAI's attempt to set up rules and logic for the blackbox of intelligence fascinates me a lot. Of course, there is a lot to learn and I view the field of responsible AI a good starting point.

Anyhow, welcome to my website. I post ideas, on-going projects, weird problems of MPS, and other random stuff here. (Let's see how this will go...) Feel free to reach me via email (hire me).
