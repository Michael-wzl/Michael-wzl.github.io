Abstract:
Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to
power large-scale image retrieval systems, raising serious pri-
vacy concerns. Services like Clearview AI and PimEyes al-
low anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a large
amount of online content associated with that person. This
not only enables identity inference but also exposes their dig-
ital footprint, such as social media activity, private photos,
and news reports, often without their consent. In response to
this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a user-centric pri-
vacy protection method that safeguards facial images from
such retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates
a user’s 3D facial signatures into a pose-invariant 2D rep-
resentation, which is dynamically deformed into a natural-
looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of any
facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing.
Motivated by a critical limitation of existing methods, Pro-
tego amplifies the sensitivity of FR models so that protected
images cannot be matched even among themselves. Experi-
ments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accu-
racy across a wide range of black-box FR models and per-
forms at least 2×better than existing methods. It also offers
unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video settings
where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Over-
all, Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR
for mass surveillance and unsolicited identity tracing.
