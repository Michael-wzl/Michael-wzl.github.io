The MTCNN that makes full use of PyTorch and Torchvision! I never understand why common MTCNN-PyTorch implementations have to convert images back to PIL Images and back to Tensors again and again. This implementation avoids that and is much faster. See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Michael-wzl/mtcnn_pytorch).
